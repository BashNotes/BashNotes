IN PROGRESS:
   - CD Search
      - Analyze results in /proj123/projects/zapata/kylecampbell/kylecampbell_zapata/Zapata/Technical/ASIC/sim/src/python/pv_post_processing/zapata_scripts/IPTOP/IpTopCdSearchTest_2023-12-11_results_1/
      - Use Josh's script at /proj123/projects/zapata/kylecampbell/kylecampbell_zapata/Zapata/Technical/ASIC/sim/src/python/pv_post_processing/zapata_scripts/IPTOP/plot_IpTopLOLREACQTest.py

DONE:
   - Employee Survey
   - CD Search
      - Modify IpTopTestPlanTestGen.py, shelved in CL 5522
         - IpTopRxPerfNgbrChnsTest
         - mode:{1,3}
         - OSNR: 16.5 [dB]
         - cdEstError: {-2*stepSize, -stepSize, -stepSize/2, 0}
            - This is the cdEstError parameter. That is, cdFiberLen=max-maxRange but CDMF is configured to a different value than the CD in the channel mimicking a CD estimation error.
         - numSeeds: 3

Weekly Zapata CSIM Team Meeting @ 11:30 am:
   - Shareed in-progress CD Search results
   - Need to plot the following vs tine: symbol lock, freq lock, demod lock, FPR EsNo, RX2 Constellation output EsNo
   - Mode 1 cdEstError = -10000, Mode 3 cdEstError = -16000
   - Expect FPR EsNo to be useful for if CD is "close enough", after (true) freq lock
   - Interested in also testing FPR EsNo vs RX2 Const EsNo for various OSNR values
