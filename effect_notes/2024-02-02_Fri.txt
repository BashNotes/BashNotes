IN PROGRESS:
   - Task 12: Define and document set of Effect API calls to cover all configuration/operation of Durian Module
      - This list should  map to all required API calls for Deneb operation.
      - Results of this task should be initial SPI reference document for Durian and Zapata.

      - StartAdcCal
      - Remove DscConfigureInterrupts
      - Interrupt handling routine
      - StartCdmfSearch
      - GetCdmfSearchStatus
      - esimate

      - Meet with Murat and Sameep over API calls

      - Deneb API command ID from deneb_enum.py

TODO:
   - Guinea Pig for Bitbucket

   - Help Eric F write Programmer's Guide
      - ADC CAL DC Offset
      - ADC CAL Gain Offset
      - ADC CAL Phase Offset
      - ADC CAL Timing Offset
      - Analog AGC
      - DSC Skew Estimator

   - Task 6: Review relevant Deneb API calls against what is needed for Zapata
      - Identify calls that overlap (need equivalent calls defined)
      - Identify gaps that need to be filled (need new calls defined)
      - Identify target MCU (chip or module), can use Jihad to help guide
      - Look into Zapata_Deneb_Opcode_Overview.xlsx, add Deneb API calls for each row

   - Task 10: Bring up Deneb eval board and verify configuration and operation for 100G ZR mode via GUI
      - Confirm startup script: startup_py_v1p8p3/mode_100G_QPSK_30_1b_47.py

   - Read through Credo Dove SDK

   - Read OpenRISC thesis

   - Udemy Embedded Software Design Patterns
   - Read Polarization Mode Dispersion book
   - SDK studying

DONE:
   - Meet with Eric S to discuss API document
   - Review Programmer's Guide Template before 14:30 meeting
   - Identify root cause of tiaOutputSwing not affecting 

   - Task 4: Review Credo Dove eval board user guide and compare with Deneb eval board documentation.
      - Are there similar API calls?
      - Can we start to map some of the calls and control/status procedures to what we will need for Zapata?
      - May be worth looking at this but may not provide a lot of value if Credo is going to give us the code base.
   - Notes: 
      - CFD40401 Evaluation Board User Guide
         - Similar to Deneb, comes with SDK and GUI software. Uses python 3 scripts instead of python 2
         - API calls are structured as python functions
         - Uses ipython (similar to Jupyter) for interactive configuration and debugging of DSP
         - Dove GUI allows for extensive use of the SDK through a GUI interface
         - Most initialization is done with one function, init_dove410(mode, target, tuning=True, reset=True, lane=[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7])
         - User guide is not a comprehensive list of API calls
         - If I have a comprehensive list, then I could add a column to the opcode overview comparing Deneb and Dove API calls
