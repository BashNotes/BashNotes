   - Read the Canopus EVK Quick Bring-up start to finish, see if I can run the python startup script for 100G ZR, which is mode_100G_QPSK_30_1b_47.py
   - I'll update the instructions here for connecting to the board, running the startup script, configuring for internal loopback, monitoring, etc.

               - Nishann needs help with this

         - 196: OFEC and SCFEC
         - 208: Ball Map

         - Testing internal loopback
            - real time BER
            - can view constellations
            - can change skew and see BER change


      - Nishaan call
         - Identify connectors needed for electrical loopback
         - Get internal loopback working on our board
         - Get access to Maynard EVK
         - Bobby Carlin to request supplies
         - Robert Palmer wrote Deneb GUI utility
         - Nishaan working on optics, electrical loopback

- Task 10: Bring up Deneb eval board and verify configuration and operation for 100G ZR mode via GUI
   - ClevelandLab python project
   - start_100G_ZR_internal_loopback.py
   - set_vdd function missing
   - GetIngressSmState stuck in 4, sometimes 1

- Talk with Nishaan
   - Showed my shared screen
   - Looking at bitbucket
   - DTS0021, page 26
   - 13 and 13w, different oversampling rate
   - mode_100G_dQPSK_1_13_1
      - staircase, 3/2
   - mode_100G_dQPSK_2_13w_245

   - Nishaan has deneb_api.py script, still buggy
   - Ask if he'll be in the lab tomorrow/today

------------------------------------- TODO --------------------------------------
- Set up Global Protect VPN
   - Respond to Jesse van Asselt if needed

- Security Culture Survey

- Zapata API definitions:
   - Update the RX1 definitions with details on whether they are intended to be used by the user or developer, in a new column.
   - Group the config and status API calls by function.
   - All of the individual DscSet... calls go under the single DscSetConfig API call (same with the DscGet calls under DscGetConfig).
   - In the end, maybe have Set and Get calls for Adc, Dsc, Agc, and Cdmf and another similar set for the get status of those functions

- Programmer's Guide:
   - Complete the Programmer's Guide for the RX1 modules, including details about the User API calls.
      - ADC CAL
         - Deferred until we discuss the status of these modules
         - See thread in zpt_rx1
      - DSC
         - Resampler
         - Phase Imbalance
         - Gain Imbalance
         - IQ Correction
         - Dynamic Skew Estimator
      - CAR
      - Digital AGC
      - CDMF

- User's Guide:
   - Update the User's Guide for the RX1 modules, which should be a subset of the Programmer's Guide, so should just be some copy and pasting.

- Udemy Embedded Software Design Patterns
- Read Polarization Mode Dispersion book

------------------------------------- DONE --------------------------------------
- Write guide for connecting to board

- Weekly DSP Team Meeting Notes
   - http://gg.gg/weekly_dsp_team_meeting_notes

------------------------------------- NOTES -------------------------------------

Meet with Nishaan
- start_gui.bat starts DSP GUI
   - double click, select boot FW
   - going through 13w one more time, getting garbage
   - dropdown menu can be modified with python script, copy from mode
   - select mode, select internal loopback
   - click configure traffic
   - Poll BER every 1000 ms
   - Constellation heatmap
   - TX/RX Skew (ps), HIQ, VIQ, HV
   - H/V swaps, maybe not effective
   - Check over modes 13 and 13w, ensure they are correct
   - Mode 9 is working
   - Mode 13 was working, BER 1.0


------------------ Weekly DSP Team Meeting @ 11:00 2024-02-27 ------------------
Russell:
- Communicating with Broadcom, getting contract together
- Making holistic, top level schedule for Phoenix
- Working internally on documents with Broadcom
- Putting together on integrated schedule
- More FW work than what we envisioned originally
- More HW work needs to be done, naturally
- Thinking about in-house resources vs BSS
- Hopefully next week will have a more solidified schedule
- Easier for us to track long-term

Nishaan & Kyle:
- Update on Deneb EVK progress, internal and electrical loopback

Kyle:
- Suggestion for transcribing Weekly Cleveland Team Meeting
- Matt will provide location for OneNote for meeting notes
