IN PROGRESS:

DONE:
- CD Search
   - Modify IpTopTestPlanTestGen.py, shelved in CL 5522
      - IpTopRxPerfNgbrChnsTest
      - mode:{1,3}
      - OSNR: 16.5 [dB]
      - cdEstError: {-2*stepSize, -stepSize, -stepSize/2, 0}
         - This is the cdEstError parameter. That is, cdFiberLen=max-maxRange but CDMF is configured to a different value than the CD in the channel mimicking a CD estimation error.
      - numSeeds: 3
   - Analyze results in /proj123/projects/zapata/kylecampbell/kylecampbell_zapata/Zapata/Technical/ASIC/sim/src/python/pv_post_processing/zapata_scripts/IPTOP/IpTopCdSearchTest_2023-12-11_results_1/
   - Use Josh's script at /proj123/projects/zapata/kylecampbell/kylecampbell_zapata/Zapata/Technical/ASIC/sim/src/python/pv_post_processing/zapata_scripts/IPTOP/plot_IpTopLOLREACQTest.py
   - Made new script, plot_IpTopCdSearchTest.py, based on plot_IpTopLOLREACQTest.py
   - Submitted changes to CL 5561

SDK Meeting @ 9:30 am:
   Roberto:
      - Challenges with Credo, pin that
      - Met with Molex 2 weeks ago, one of the top 5 manufactures
      - Want to private label our 100GB module
      - Develop a plan to mitigate uncertainty in tape-out of DSP
      - Want to develop everything so that we can just drop in our DSP (firmware, front-end, etc.)
      - Another 100G module that will consume a lot more power
      - Write SDK for our DSP to look similar to this one
   - Then it's more of a porting exercise to swap in our chip
   - We have access to SDK and source code, but really just want to structure similarly
   - Use de facto industry-accepted standard for our DSP SDK

Town Hall @ 11:00 am:
   Mission, Vision, and Values:
      - Mission: Interconnect an ever-changing world by making light and digitally powered solutions sustainable, affordable, and scalable.
      - Vision: Unlocking the power of light to make a difference in people's lives.
      - Values:
         - Own it! We take ownership of our responsibilities, actions, and decisions. We say what we we do what we say. We drive to completion.
         - Value Time. Time is a scarce resource. We appreciate its impact and use it wisely to deliver for our colleagues, customers, and stakeholders.
         - Embrace the Challenge. In a dynamic and fast-changing environment, we push the boundaries of innovation by tapping into our collective passion, creativity, and expertise.
         - Empower Together. Powered by diversity and belonging, we are stronger as a team where mutual respect, integrity, and transparency underlies all we do.
   Why change our statements?
      - Big shift in company a few months after Viasat team joined; moved from in-house manufacturing to outsourced
      - Change in organization at the top
   Milestones:
      - Coming to the end of milestones written last year
      - Missed deadlines, SFP issues, but the sky didn't fall
      - SFP+/SFP28
         - First fully integrated FW
         - First customer samples on 18 Dec
         - Fully built by FBN/Jabil
      - 100G DSP
         - Gold drop achieved
         - In physical layout
      - pITLA
         - First control circuitry turned on
         - First units built at FBN (Taiwan)
         - CF2 PIC about to tapeout
      - 100GZR Module
         - Mechanical feasibility completed
   Funding Update:
      - Goal: 50M Euros
      - Verbal commitments for ~35M
      - Target will be 2 closes: First close likely early Jan-2023 but pushing for end of 2023
      - Ongoing discussions for remaining 15M
      - Most coming from Dutch government, new government doesn't affect funding
