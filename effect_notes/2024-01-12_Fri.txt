Zapata SDK/API Kickoff @ 10:30am:
   - Team member introduction
   - John Sutherland will be a "customer" of SDK
   - Want to develop a familiar/industry standard SDK/API for Zapata
   - Have Marvel Deneb EVK and FW as a reference
   - Zapata, stripped down somewhat from Deneb
   - Want to develop SDK to use Orion module, which will use Deneb chip
   - Allow for Orion to use Zapata
   - Want top layer, customer-facing layer, to be the same between Deneb and Zapata
   - Lower layers will of course have different functionality between the two
   - Want to better understand the structure of the Deneb EVK, layers of FW and microcontrollers
   - Credo says tapeout around April, planning on having things ready around June
   - SPI interface between external MCU and Deneb chip
   - Want to define subset of Deneb API commands that would be needed for Orion, Zapata
   - Jihad is a proponent for emulating FW and interfacing with Zapata simulation
   - Evaluate long lead time items, short and long term steps, schedule
   - Start assigning tasks to individuals
   - Start creating our own API reference document, starting with a skeleton

NOTES:
- Zapata vs Deneb Comparison
   - Zapata
      - Controlled through APB Interface to read and write ACT registers
   - Deneb w/ MCU
      - Controlled through SPI Interface
      - Message based, with header and payload
      - Without FW, can read and write registers via SPI
      - With FW, can send high level commands to perform more complex operations
      - User creates message to send to Deneb FW, FW performs the operation based on the message
      - We do not have the firmware source code, only the binaries
      - C and Python code provided creates and sends the messages to FW
