   - high*Bandwidth12
   - Read the Canopus EVK Quick Bring-up start to finish, see if I can run the python startup script for 100G ZR, which is mode_100G_QPSK_30_1b_47.py
   - I'll update the instructions here for connecting to the board, running the startup script, configuring for internal loopback, monitoring, etc.

   - ssh root@192.168.145.183
      - What is the root password?
      - canopus_leopard, deneb_eval don't work

   - ClevelandLab python project
      - start_100G_ZR_internal_loopback.py
      - set_vdd function missing
      - GetIngressSmState stuck in 4, sometimes 1


------------------------------------- TODO --------------------------------------
- Set up Global Protect VPN
   - Respond to Jesse van Asselt if needed

- Read ARM documentation
   - https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0194/h?lang=en

- Zapata API definitions:
   - Update the RX1 definitions with details on whether they are intended to be used by the user or developer, in a new column.
   - Group the config and status API calls by function.
   - All of the individual DscSet... calls go under the single DscSetConfig API call (same with the DscGet calls under DscGetConfig).
   - In the end, maybe have Set and Get calls for Adc, Dsc, Agc, and Cdmf and another similar set for the get status of those functions

- Programmer's Guide:
   - Complete the Programmer's Guide for the RX1 modules, including details about the User API calls.
      - ADC CAL
         - Deferred until we discuss the status of these modules
         - See thread in zpt_rx1
      - DSC
         - Resampler
         - Phase Imbalance
         - Gain Imbalance
         - IQ Correction
         - Dynamic Skew Estimator
      - CAR
      - Digital AGC
      - CDMF

- User's Guide:
   - Update the User's Guide for the RX1 modules, which should be a subset of the Programmer's Guide, so should just be some copy and pasting.

- Task 10: Bring up Deneb eval board and verify configuration and operation for 100G ZR mode via GUI
   - Confirm startup script: startup_py_v1p8p3/mode_100G_QPSK_30_1b_47.py

- Read OpenRISC thesis

- Udemy Embedded Software Design Patterns
- Read Polarization Mode Dispersion book
- SDK studying

------------------------------------- DONE --------------------------------------
- Improve notes formatting

------------------------------------- NOTES -------------------------------------
SDK/API Team Meeting @ 2024-02-14, 11:00
- Pivoting from Credo work, work on Programmer's Guide
- Get questions answered about modules, registers, etc
- Provide pseudocode such that BSS could write it
- No ADC/DAC CAL needed going forward, easier SERDES bringup
- Need FW framework from Broadcom
- SPI bus for comms between MCU and chip

DSP Program - Q&A @ 2024-02-20, 10:00
- Open discussion on how we do 100G going forward
- Roberto: Credo path didn't go well, why did we pick Credo in the first place?
   - In the beginning of Zapata, Nov 2022, restructuring, manufacturing strategy, market research
   - Plot of Credo in Nov 2022, Credo doing well against peers
      - Growth vs Return on Investment
   - Picking Credo was the right choice, financially and from investor perspective
   - Credo got hit hard in 2023, customer canceled large project
   - We didn't know the behavior of the engineering team ahead of time
   - Credo engineering team didn't have same buy-in as business team
   - Partnership didn't turn out as expected
   - We are in a different place today
- Kyle: What if we went with Broadcom instead of Credo?
   - Roberto: Broadcom is an ASIC company, more familiar with our work
   - Would have been better, but not feasible at the time for financial reasons
- Supply chain, building product team, etc is behind us
- We are doing what we would have done if we could have afforded it in Nov 2022
- Cost to buy chip from Broadcom vs Credo is less
- DSP will have our name on it, not Credo's or Broadcom's
- Roberto: How are we going to go do this?
   - Russell: 1000 ft view, identical to what was before, keep it simple
- Goals:
   - ASIC in our hand in 2024 is important, final towards end of April
   - August want to have chip finished
- Jason: What if schedule pushes out to 2025?
   - Roberto: Will tell us if things go sour
   - Chip is solid, just needs changes to get to Broadcom
   - Jason: Schedule, scope, cost. Choosing schedule ahead of all details. Are we flexible with cost?
   - Our team needs to focus on schedule, Roberto can handle to cost
   - Need to be realistic in terms of expectations, achievable goals
   - We need to be honest with ourselves in order to be successful
- Jason: We need more people in implementation, other teams, if we want to do things quick
   - Need resources to meet these dates
- Costs money to do Deneb, Durian DSP
- Write things down, make block diagrams, be transparent

- Suggestions on strategy from Kyle, informed from suggestions of others
   - Keep it simple
      - Document all changes needed, prefer no changes unless needed
   - Proactive, not reactive
      - Need expectations from the very beginning on ownership of tasks, EFFECT vs BSS vs Broadcom
      - I prefer owning our own work over Broadcom, even if it takes longer on paper
      - Do not reinvent the wheel
         - Much better to utilize third-party products than building something from scratch
         - Using ARM MCU instead of OpenRISC, for example
      - No last minute or unexpected changes, should be known well ahead of time
   - Clearly lay out what changes are needed at a high level
      - Translate those into SYS/PV/DV/IMP/RTL tasks, with estimated time
   - Lean towards worst case time estimates, informed from experience
   - Utilize BSS, or hire more employees/contractors if needed, to meet long-term goals
   - Clearly delineate tasks from which company down to which employee does what
   - Need a project manager, full-time resource for intra and inter company communication, defining and managing tasks
   - Need to plan schedule around worst-case or near worst-case estimates, so we can be confident that we meet the schedule
   - August schedule needs to be realistic given our current resources
      - If not realistic, we need more people
      - Crunch is okay and expected, but needs to be on the order of days, not weeks or months
      - More work for each person could just lead to burnout
   - Audit our resources: SYS/PV/DV/IMP/RTL team, considering overlap of experience
      - Do we have everyone that we need?
      - Do we need more PV, IMP (referencing Jason), resources?
   - Need to be attentive to schedule slip, communicate early, move resources around

Town Hall @ 2024-02-20, 11:00
- Funding
   - Commitment for $38 million, signing has started
   - Mid-late March time frame
- Products
   - Manufacturing is hands-off at this point
   - Sent out samples to SFP to customer, testing went well
      - 250 products shipped
      - Working with value added retailer, could ship 10,000 units
   - Pico Tunable Laser
      - Took less than 4 weeks
      - Leveraged same manufacturing processes
      - First design, TOSA, used same manufacturing processes
      - Will be demoed at OFC
   - Will be integrating optical front end with Deneb, COSA
- Credo is behind us, some legal things still need tied up

Performance Review @ 2024-02-20, 13:00
