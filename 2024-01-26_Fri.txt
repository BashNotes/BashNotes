TODO:
   - Task 6: Review relevant Deneb API calls against what is needed for Zapata
      - Identify calls that overlap (need equivalent calls defined)
      - Identify gaps taht need to be filled (need new calls defined)
      - Identify target MCU (chip or module), can use Jihad to help guide
      - Look into Zapata_Deneb_Opcode_Overview.xlsx, add Deneb API calls for each row

   - Task 10: Bring up Deneb eval board and verify configuration and operation for 100G ZR mode via GUI
      - Confirm startup script: startup_py_v1p8p3/mode_100G_QPSK_30_1b_47.py

   - Udemy Embedded Software Design Patterns
   - Read Polarization Mode Dispersion book
   - SDK studying

IN PROGRESS:
   - Debug index 128 in cdmf_cfg, CL 5651
      - IpTopTest with cdFiberLen = 100e3
      - Without updates, (24, 29)
      - With updates, (20, 28)
      - gdb says (-12, -4)?
      - scale_mid is (-241, -87) which is (-0.94140625, -0.33984375)

   - Move python script to Perforce

   - Task 12: Define and document set of Effect API calls to cover all configuration/operation of Durian Module
      - This list should  map to all required API calls for Deneb operation.
      - Results of this task should be initial SPI reference document for Durian and Zapata.

   - Read through Credo Dove SDK

   - Read OpenRISC thesis

DONE:
   - Review Programmer's Guide for RX1

   - Write python script for configuring taps
      - 32x6 array of s2.5 values, integer and phase components
      - User provides config file, HI HQ VI VQ delays
      - Sets static_skew_xx and taps for HI HQ VI VQ lanes
      - Prints to standard out
      - TODO: Use pv_sim_branch to generate config
      - Pick some random rxHiqSkew rxViqSkew rxHvSkew values, see what registers are set
      - Get taps from file, put into python 2D array of ints

   - Zapata Rail DSP and FEC IP Core: Programmer's Guide
      - Missing "of" in last sentence Memory Map section
      - 7.1.4.2: Modulation Format includes 8QAM and 16QAM
      - 7.2.3 RX Downsampler only has one ratio for all modes, ~4/5
      - 7.2.5 RX DC Offset Correction doesn't exist in Zapata
      - IQ and Phase Imbalance are barely changed from Gemini
      - CD has a programmable matched filter but defaults to all-pass
      - Need to verify updated number of taps and bitwidth

   - Task 4: Review Credo Dove eval board user guide and compare with Deneb eval board documentation.
      - Are there similar API calls?
      - Can we start to map some of the calls and control/status procedures to what we will need for Zapata?
      - May be worth looking at this but may not provide a lot of value if Credo is going to give us the code base.
   - Notes: 
      - CFD40401 Evaluation Board User Guide
         - Similar to Deneb, comes with SDK and GUI software. Uses python 3 scripts instead of python 2
         - API calls are structured as python functions
         - Uses ipython (similar to Jupyter) for interactive configuration and debugging of DSP
         - Dove GUI allows for extensive use of the SDK through a GUI interface
         - Most initialization is done with one function, init_dove410(mode, target, tuning=True, reset=True, lane=[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7])
         - User guide is not a comprehensive list of API calls
         - If I have a comprehensive list, then I could add a column to the opcode overview comparing Deneb and Dove API calls

   - Figure out startup mode for Durian
      - 1b, 100G ZR
   - Performance self-review (Due 1/17)
   - Add walkthrough of API and documents to Deneb Internal Getting Started Guide.docx

Programmers Guide @ 1:00 PM
   - Has enough information for registers and internal configuration
   - Eric F wondering how to write about firmware
   - Issue with static fractional skew, determined by tap phase
   - 5 bit number representing fractional skew
   - Do we include info on setting static skew taps in programmer's guide?

- Provide instructions for setting of taps in programmer's guide
- Ifdefs and function calls
- Where to find taps file
- Or CfgByFile calls
- Python script to simulate this and generate taps
