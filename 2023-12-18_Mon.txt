NOTES:

- Murat in top meeting talked to daniel
- We could look for freq lock, check if all lanes are out of search
- Log all_prelanes_locked

- Write z_rw_dpp_control_freeze_perlane_status_b to 1;   // latch in 20-lane information synchronously.
- Write z_rw_per_lane_status_addr to 0;  // State information for lane 0.
- Read z_rw_per_lane_status_data;  // bit [2]: "0" this lane is not in SEARCH. "1" this lane is in SEARCH state.
- Write z_rw_per_lane_status_addr to 8; // State information for lane 1.
- Read z_rw_per_lane_status_data;  // bit [2]: "0" this lane is not in SEARCH. "1" this lane is in SEARCH state.
- Write z_rw_per_lane_status_addr to 16; // State information for lane 2.
- Read z_rw_per_lane_status_data;  // bit [2]: "0" this lane is not in SEARCH. "1" this lane is in SEARCH state
- ........ Continue for all 20 lanes.
- Write z_rw_per_lane_status_addr to 152; // State information for lane 19.
- Read z_rw_per_lane_status_data;  // bit [2]: "0" this lane is not in SEARCH. "1" this lane is in SEARCH state
- If all 20-lanes are out of SEARCH state, then DPP is likely to get demod_lock in the future.
- Write z_rw_dpp_control_freeze_perlane_status_b to 0; // undo latch.
