NOTES:
CD Search FW Emulation Test:
   - 10 trials
   - op_mode = {1, 3}
   - OSNR = 16.5
   - Randomly set CD value from 0 to max for each trial
   - For each trial, sweep cdEstError = [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]*stepSize
   - End test if no AllLanesPrelocked within 260 frames for mode 1, 320 frames for mode 3
   - If AllLanesPrelocked event happens, record FPR EsNo for 30 frames after
