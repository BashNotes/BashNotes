TODO:
   - Performance self-review (Due 1/17)
   - Udemy Embedded Software Design Patterns
   - SDK studying

IN PROGRESS:
   - Deneb docs
      - Deneb API Reference Manual
      - Deneb Datasheet 1.2
         - 1.0 Overview
         - 2.0 Introduction
         - 5.0 - 5.7 Serial Peripheral Interface
         - 6.0 Embedded Microprocessor
- Zapata vs Deneb Comparison
   - Zapata
      - Controlled through APB Interface to read and write ACT registers
   - Deneb w/ MCU
      - Controlled through SPI Interface
      - Message based, with header and payload
      - Without FW, can read and write registers via SPI
      - With FW, can send high level commands to perform more complex operations
      - User creates message to send to Deneb FW, FW performs the operation based on the message
      - We do not have the firmware source code, only the binaries
      - C and Python code provided creates and sends the messages to FW

      - Deneb Startup Procedure.pdf
         - Focus on Ref 1 Mode 13 ID 1: 100G dQPSK, Staircase
            - startup_py_v1p27p0p0/mode_100G_dQPSK_1_13_1.py
