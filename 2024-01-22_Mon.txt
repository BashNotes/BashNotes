TODO:
   - Task 4: Review Credo Dove eval board user guide and compare with Deneb eval board documentation.
      - Are there similar API calls?
      - Can we start to map some of the calls and control/status procedures to what we will need for Zapata?
      - May be worth looking at this but may not provide a lot of value if Credo is going to give us the code base.

   - Task 6: Review relevant Deneb API calls against what is needed for Zapata
      - Identify calls that overlap (need equivalent calls defined)
      - Identify gaps taht need to be filled (need new calls defined)
      - Identify target MCU (chip or module), can use Jihad to help guide
      - Look into Zapata_Deneb_Opcode_Overview.xlsx, add Deneb API calls for each row

   - Task 10: Bring up Deneb eval board and verify configuration and operation for 100G ZR mode via GUI
      - Confirm startup script: startup_py_v1p8p3/mode_100G_QPSK_30_1b_47.py

   - Task 12: Define and document set of Effect API calls to cover all configuration/operation of Durian Module
      - This list should  map to all required API calls for Deneb operation.
      - Results of this task should be initial SPI reference document for Durian and Zapata.

   - Udemy Embedded Software Design Patterns

Working Meeting @ 1:00 PM
   - Task list in Sharepoint
   - Ongoing conversation with Credo
   - Information on embedded MCU subsystem

NOTES:
- Zapata vs Deneb Comparison
   - Zapata
      - Controlled through APB Interface to read and write ACT registers
   - Deneb w/ MCU
      - Controlled through SPI Interface
      - Message based, with header and payload
      - Without FW, can read and write registers via SPI
      - With FW, can send high level commands to perform more complex operations
      - User creates message to send to Deneb FW, FW performs the operation based on the message
      - We do not have the firmware source code, only the binaries
      - C and Python code provided creates and sends the messages to FW
