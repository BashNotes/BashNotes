IN PROGRESS:
   - Finish Homework 1

   - Figure out bill for Mount Carmel

TODO:
   - Read ARM documentation
      - https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0194/h?lang=en

   - Sign up for Huntington Autopay

   - Deneb Board Bringup
      - high*Bandwidth12
      - Read the Canopus EVK Quick Bring-up start to finish, see if I can run the python startup script for 100G ZR, which is mode_100G_QPSK_30_1b_47.py
      - I'll update the instructions here for connecting to the board, running the startup script, configuring for internal loopback, monitoring, etc.
 
   - Zapata API definitions:
      - Update the RX1 definitions with details on whether they are intended to be used by the user or developer, in a new column.
      - Group the config and status API calls by function.
      - All of the individual DscSet... calls go under the single DscSetConfig API call (same with the DscGet calls under DscGetConfig).U
      - In the end, maybe have Set and Get calls for Adc, Dsc, Agc, and Cdmf and another similar set for the get status of those functions.

    
   - Programmer's Guide:
      - Complete the Programmer's Guide for the RX1 modules, including details about the User API calls.
         - ADC CAL
            - Deferred until we discuss the status of these modules
            - See thread in zpt_rx1
         - DSC
            - Resampler
            - Phase Imbalance
            - Gain Imbalance
            - IQ Correction
            - Dynamic Skew Estimator
         - CAR
         - Digital AGC
         - CDMF

   - User's Guide:
      - Update the User's Guide for the RX1 modules, which should be a subset of the Programmer's Guide, so should just be some copy and pasting.

   - Task 10: Bring up Deneb eval board and verify configuration and operation for 100G ZR mode via GUI
      - Confirm startup script: startup_py_v1p8p3/mode_100G_QPSK_30_1b_47.py

   - Read OpenRISC thesis

   - Udemy Embedded Software Design Patterns
   - Read Polarization Mode Dispersion book
   - SDK studying

DONE:

FW meeting
   - Pivoting from Credo work, work on Programmer's Guide
   - Get questions answered about modules, registers, etc
   - Provide pseudocode such that BSS could write it
   - No ADC/DAC CAL needed going forward, easier SERDES bringup
   - Need FW framework from Broadcomm
   - SPI bus for comms between MCU and chip
